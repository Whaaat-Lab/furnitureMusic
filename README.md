# Furniture Music

a) An interactive experience that meshes furniture placement with soundscape manipulation. 

b) A terrible play on words based on Eric Satie's concept of [musique dâ€™ameublement](https://soundcloud.com/user1401258/satie-whittington-a-suite-of-furniture). 

c) An excuse to explore using the MDMA (Method for Design Materialisation and Analysis) approach of documenting process from [Pippin Barr](http://www.pippinbarr.com), [Rilla Khaled](http://www.rillakhaled.com) and [Jonathan Lessard's](https://jonathanlessard.net) [Games as Research project](https://www.gamesasresearch.com)
