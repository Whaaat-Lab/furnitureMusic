This whole thing begins with us thinking about exploratory alternative input devices (Bearwarp's [geobio](https://vimeo.com/259809620), for example). But how can we translate the methodology behind physical exploration into pure game-control? Additionally, can this control be used to influence the overall sonic landscape of a game experience, hopefully leveraging the music to create slow and/or contemplative experiences.

Secondly, this stems from an interest in Eric Satie's notion of [Furniture Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture_music), or music composed for a given architectural environment. Obviously the project naming and execution makes light of this, but especially in Eno's [Ambient 1: Music for Airports](https://open.spotify.com/album/063f8Ej8rLVTz9KkjQKEMa), we feel that there was a potential for real symbiosis between architectural and sonic decisions. 

This initial commit uses the [Low Poly Modular Living Room](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/low-poly-modular-living-room-128552) asset from Cenk Sanusoglu on the Unity Asset store. We have implemented click and dragging the furniture. The stage will be to compose a soundscape for the environment.
